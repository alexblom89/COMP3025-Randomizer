My assignment allows the user to create a set of items such as books, movies, or any other category; and the program will randomly select one of the items and display it. 

The program has two model classes: Set and SetItem. SetItems belong to the Sets (so Lord of the Rings belongs to Books). Sets and SetItems are displayed as a vertical linear list
using an adapter.
