# COMP3025 Mobile Computing Assignment

The purpose of this assignment is to create an MVC Android application with user authentication and database access. 
My project, titled "The Randomizer", allows users to create their own Sets of items; such as books, movies, restaurants, games, etc.; which when selected will display a random item from that set. This lets an indecisive user allow the app to make their decision for them if they cannot decide on where to eat, what movie to watch, etc. 

## The application was created using Kotlin, Android Studio, and a Firestore NOSQL database. User Authentication is provided by Firebase Authentication. The final project was published on the Google Play Store.
